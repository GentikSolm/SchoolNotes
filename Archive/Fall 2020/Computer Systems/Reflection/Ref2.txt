Class Reflection week 2.
This week in class, 5 important things I have learned are as follows;
First, how Integrated circuits are made. Understanding this can help lead to innovations in how one would
    decrease cost or increase production. For instance knowing the relationship between defects and area could lead to
    a mathematical model that would maximize cost to yield ratio.
Second, seeing how some metrics in a computer system must be sacrificed for others, as shown in the plan analogy. For instance,
    a super fast processer might not be able to run at a easy to maintain temperature, just as the cruising speed of a BAC is high, it sacrifices
    its range and passenger capacity.
Third, CPU clocking. Knowing how the CPU does calculations but only updates at the end of every clock cycle enables a better general understanding
    of how to read specifications of computer systems.
Fourth, how to read and determine execution time. Now when creating programs or judging others programs, I can have a more informed understanding
    of what the numbers actually mean.
fifth, response time versus throughput. this is critical information especially for when designing computer systems. Knowing that you cannot
    increase response time by adding more CPU's, but only by getting a faster CPU, or that the fastest way to increase throughput is by
    adding more CPU/CPU cores is extremely important for any Computer science or Computer engineer student.
