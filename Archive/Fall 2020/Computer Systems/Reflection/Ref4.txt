Class Reflection week 4.
This week in class, 5 important things I have learned are as follows;
First, Detailed operations of MIPS, such as addi, or how to use addi to subtract. These are obviously
    useful, as they are the building blocks of understanding and writing machine code.
Second, Using the zero register is useful to know that there are ticks to making writing more efficiently.
    knowing how to use these low level language tricks is useful to understand how the high level languages could
    be written to maximize efficiently.
Third, Understanding how to count and read binary is probably the most important, as it is the language
    of computer systems. Knowing how to count in a new base (base 2, vs base 10) also makes it easier to
    understand future counting systems with different bases. Are there any other counting bases that are
    commonly used in computer?
Fourth, the 2s complement signed integers. understanding how to read signed bits is equally as important as
    understanding binary, as its also used commonly in computer systems. Being able to understand how in a signed, the range
    is from -2m to +2m, vs non signed of +4m (for 32bit), lets one understand which to use in what scenario.
Fifth, finally, knowing the difference between registers and memory is important for making sure ones code
    or computer system is utilizing its variables in the most efficient way. If you program is storing all of its
    variables in memory instead of registers, it will be very slow. being able to balance often-used variables vs
    non common variables and knowing how to move them in and out of memory / register using machine code lets us
    also write more complex programs in machine code.
