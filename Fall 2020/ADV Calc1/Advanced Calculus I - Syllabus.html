<b>WEB PAGE</b>:
<br>
<br>
All information regarding the course will be communicated to you via the course <a href="http://golovaty.akromath.org/">web page</a>.
 Every Tuesday and Thursday, I will post a recording of a lecture for 
that day, along with the lecture notes. I will be on Webex (access code:
 642 481 711, you can also use this <a href="https://uakron.webex.com/join/dmitry">link</a>)
 during the regular class time to answer all questions that you may have
 - feel free to join and ask if you need anything explained/clarified.
<br>
<br>
<b>APPROXIMATE COURSE CONTENT</b>:
<br>
<br>
Selected topics from chapters 1 through 5 in Ross.<br>
<br>
<b>EVALUATION</b>:
<br>
<br>
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam that will be given 
online. The midterm exams are tentatively scheduled on 09/24/20 and 
10/29/20. The final exam will be given during the regularly scheduled 
final exam period. On the day of an exam, I will post it on my webpage 
at 10:45 am. Simultaneously, you will have to connect via Webex with 
your camera on and the microphone off (unless you need to ask a 
question). You will have one hour and fifteen minutes to work on the 
exam and submit your answers back to me (possibly, more time will be 
given during the final). You will have to work it out on paper, scan, 
and send it back to me <b>IN PDF FORMAT</b> in order to get credit. It 
is essential that you show all of your work. The use of any external 
help during the exams, e.g., assitance from other students or from 
online services such as Chegg is not allowed.
<br>
<br>
<b>GRADES</b>:
<br>
<br>
The final grade will be based on the number of points (out of 450) that 
you will accumulate during the semester. In addition to midterms (100 
points each) and the final (150 points), the total score takes into 
account homework, with the 100 points alloted for this purpose. 
<br><br>
<u><b>IMPORTANT</b></u>: If your performance on the final is better than
 your performance on the other exams, the final might be counted more 
heavily than 150 points.
<br>
<br>
<b>MAKE-UP WORK</b>:
<br>
<br>
Make-up exams will be given and late homework will be accepted only in 
the case of a documented medical problem or ``emergency''. Permission to
 take a make-up exam should be obtained prior to the exam (if possible).
 Make-up exams will be given at the time determined by the professor.
<br>
<br>
<b>HOMEWORK</b>:
<br>
<br>
Homework will be posted on <a href="http://golovaty.akromath.org/~golovaty">web page</a>
 approximately every other Thursday. The due date for each assignment 
will be on Thursday, two weeks after the homework was posted. Problems 
marked with an asterisk will be collected and graded; the others may be 
discussed, but need not to be turned in. The homework should be 
submitted to me by emailing a pdf file to <i>dmitry at uakron dot edu</i>.
<br><br>
<div align="LEFT">
The importance of homework cannot be over-stressed: one can only learn 
mathematics by doing many exercises! Doing homework and writing up the 
solutions allows you to test yourself to see whether you really 
understand the material. This also protects you from being "surprised" 
on the exams.
<br>
</div>
<br>
<b>REVIEW PROBLEMS</b>:
<br>
<br>
Review problems will be distributed several days prior to each test to give you better understanding of the material. <i><u>However the tests will not necessarily contain problems similar to the ones from the corresponding review sheet.</u></i>
<br>
<br>
<b>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:</b>
<br>
<br>
Pursuant to University policy #33-59-20-01 subsection C, The University 
of Akron recognizes its responsibility for creating an institutional 
atmosphere in which students with disabilities have the opportunity to 
be successful. Any student who feels he/she may need an accommodation 
based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of 
Accessibility at 330-972-7928 (v), 330-972-5764 (tdd) or 
access@uakron.edu. The office is located in Simmons Hall Room 105.  
Accommodation letters for students with certified disabilities will be 
sent to instructors electronically. Students will request and coordinate
 all of their accommodations through the Student Testing and 
Accommodation Request System (STARS).
<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b>
<br>
<br>
The University of Akron is committed to providing an environment free of
 all forms of discrimination, including sexual violence and sexual 
harassment. This includes instances of attempted and/or completed sexual
 assault, domestic and dating violence, gender-based stalking, and 
sexual harassment.  If you (or someone you know) have experienced or 
experiences sexual violence or sexual harassment, know that you do not 
need to handle this alone. Help is available, regardless of when the 
violence or harassment occurred, and even if the person who did this is 
not a student, faculty or staff member.  Confidential help is available.
 If you wish to speak to a professional, in confidence, please contact:
<br>

    University Counseling and Testing Center - uakron.edu/counseling 330-972-7082
    Rape Crisis Center - www.rccmsc.org - 24 Hour Hotline: 877-906-RAPE
    The office is located in the Student Recreation and Wellness Center 246 and the office number is: 330-972-6328

<br>
<br>
Please know that I, as well as the majority of other University of Akron
 employees, am considered to be a "responsible employee" under the law 
and am required to report sexual harassment and sexual violence.  If you
 tell me about a situation, I will be required to report it to the Title
 IX Coordinator and possibly the police.  You will still have options 
about how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish 
to pursue a law enforcement or complaint process. You have a range of 
options available and we want to ensure you have access to the resources
 you need.
<br>
<br>
Additional information, resources, support and the University of Akron 
protocols for responding to sexual violence are available at 
uakron.edu/Title-IX.
