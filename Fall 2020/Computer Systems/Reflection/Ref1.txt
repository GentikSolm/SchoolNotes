Class Reflection week 1.
This week in class, 5 important things I have learned are as follows; First the class syllabus. Most likely the most important
piece of information pertaining to the class. How the class is structured and graded is extremely important. Second is the idea
and implication of moore's law. I never fully knew what moore's law was, and now understanding it, one can easily see why it is useful
to program in anticipation for future system specifications. Third is how much faster parallelism makes a computer system.
Being able to increase speed by even over 100x is really crazy. Fourth is the idea of pipelining, which anyone should be able
to quickly see why that's so useful. Lastly, is how much cell phones have surpassed PC in sales every year. I did not think that
it was as much of a jump as it was on the graph.
