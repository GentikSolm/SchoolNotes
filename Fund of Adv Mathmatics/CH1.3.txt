A U B = {x: x E A or x E B}
A (upside down U) B = {x: x E A and x E B}
* Two set A and B are called disjoint if A intersetcion B = null

A - B {x: x E A and x !E B}
* Difference between A and B
  - Also may be denoted as A\B

If U is the universal set, and A is a subset of U, then A^c = U-A = {x E U: x !E A}
