A U B = {x: x E A or x E B}
A (upside down U) B = {x: x E A and x E B}
* Two set A and B are called disjoint if A intersection B = null

A - B {x: x E A and x !E B}
* Difference between A and B
  - Also may be denoted as A\B

If U is the universal set, and A is a subset of U, then A^c = U-A = {x E U: x !E A}
* Property:
  - The complement of a complement is always the original set

Collection of sets:
  - Let A1, A2, . . ., An be sets (n >= 2 is an integer)
  - Then A1 U A2 U . . ., An
  = {x: x E Ai, for some i E {1,2, . . .,n}}
  * U and (intersection) can be used in a summation-like form.
