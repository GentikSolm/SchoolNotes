Theorem:
    Linear transformation is 1-1 iff N(T) = {0} vector

    Proof: Suppose T is 1-1. Let V e N(T). Then T(V) = 0
    Since T is a linear transformation, we know T(0) has to be 0.
    Therefore: T(0) = T(v) => 0 = v. hence N(T) = {0}

    Assume N(T) = {0} and T(u) = t(v)
    this implies that u = v
    then 0 = T(v) - T(u) = T(v-u) so v-u = 0, so v=u

Theorem:
    T:V->W is a linear trans & B = {v1, v2, ... vn} is a basis for V. If T is 1-1
    then {T(V1), T(V2) ... T(vn)} is a basis for R(T).
    We know span {T(v1) ... T(vn)} = R(T)
