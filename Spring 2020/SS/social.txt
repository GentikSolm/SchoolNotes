WQS - Water quality standards
    - Waterway use
        Designated use  + existing uses
    - Water quality criteria by pollutant
        Ex. Chloride: 250 mg/L
        Numeric, narrative criteria
        | narrative: no floating scum, etc
    - Impairment of use(s)
        Exceeding the criteria for receiving streams use

Total maximum daily load (TMDL)
    WasteLoad allocation - pollution reduction for point sources
    - Load allocation
        pollution from non point sources
    - WLA
        Point sources

Summit Lake
    Industrial Source
    Legacy - Discharget Sediment
    Stormwater and erosion

PCB's:
    pollutant.
    Polychlorinated biphenyls

Use Impairments
    Fish Consumption        <- PCB, mercury
    Recreation              <- Nutrients
    Aquatic Life            <- Nutrients, Chloride, TDS
    PWS - partial (Public water supply) <- PCB, Chloride, TDS

    other pollutants:
        Zinc, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, lead, mercury, Ammonia-N, iron, manganise

Nutrients: Fertilizer, wildlife, CSOs/POTWs -> LA, WLA
Chloride: Cargill discharge





Phase 1 & 2:
    Examine existing pollutants from land sources
    Both deal with the land

    Phase 2 is area !in phase 1

    Questions:
        Top 3 sources of use impairments:
            |||Extreemly low oxygen levels,|||
